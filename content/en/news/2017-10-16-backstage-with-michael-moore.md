I went to see Michael Moore's new Broadway show, "The Terms of My Surrender" and I got to say hi backstage after the show. Read the Salon piece I wrote after seeing the show [here](https://www.salon.com/2017/10/15/the-real-power-of-michael-moore-he-came-to-comedy-from-activism-not-the-other-way-around/).
