Last week billionaire and notorious &#8220;birther&#8221; Donald Trump claimed that he had a &#8220;bombshell&#8221; that would change the election: he announced that if President Obama would provide him with copies of his college and passport records that he would write a check for $5 million to the charity of Obama&#8217;s choice.


Enter Stephen Colbert who immediately responded to Trump with his own &#8220;October surprise.&#8221; In typical Colbert satirical brilliance, he out-Trumped Trump, exposing the arrogance and megalomania that led to Trump&#8217;s bizarre request. What was Colbert&#8217;s counter-offer? He would write Trump a check for $1 million to the charity of his choice if he would let Colbert &#8220;dip his balls into his mouth.&#8221; If you haven&#8217;t seen the clip, watch it here:

The joke may be a crude one, but it would be fair to say that Trump asked for it. And you gotta love Colbert&#8217;s willingness to put his balls to public service and expose the folly of Trump&#8217;s disturbing challenge.
