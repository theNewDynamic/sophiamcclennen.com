    The Lawrence and Lynne Brown Democracy Medal, presented by the McCourtney
    Institute for Democracy at Penn State, recognizes outstanding individuals,
    groups, and organizations that produce innovations to further democracy in
    the United States or around the world. The 2020 Brown Democracy Medal
    winner, Srdja Popovic, was a leader in the revolution that brought down the
    Milošević regime in Serbia and he contin-ues to help protestors around the
    world learn effective, sometimes humorous, nonviolent tactics. In 2020, he
    teamed up with Sophia A. McClennen to study the concept of "dilemma
    actions," which offers a structured, strategic approach to fighting back
    against authoritarianism, as well as for defending democracy.

Do you want to overthrow a dictator, expose political corruption, or advance democratic goals? *Pranksters vs. Autocrats* presents a proven method to help advance the goals of non-violent activists. We offer in-depth analysis and a how-to guide to dilemma actions – a tactic that helps put political opponents in a lose-lose situation and gain visibility for your movement. Non-violent activists have long known that dilemma actions are especially effective, but this is the first book to offer empirical data to prove how and why dilemma actions work. From Gandhi’s Salt March to the Arab Spring and from Estonia’s Laughing Revolution to local activism in sub-Saharan Africa, this book offers readers a diverse array of forty-four case studies that have shaped popular struggles for democracy and a wide range of human rights struggles across the globe. As you read this, we’ll explain how and why dilemma actions work and how to think like an effective organizer. If you already are an organizer, you’ll learn how to design actions that are fun, funny, and effective. Most importantly, you’ll learn about the power of creativity and wit in some of most important social change struggles of the last century.
