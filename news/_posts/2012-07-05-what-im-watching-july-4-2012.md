Stephen Colbert has called us losers. He got us (and 999 other fan groups based at universities) to buy his Super Fun Pack, filled it with what seemed like a series of gag items, and then asked us all to solve an extremely complex treasure hunt. If we solved it, we would get him to visit our school. So, even though we weren&#8217;t exclusively interested in the treasure hunt part of the game, of course we wanted first prize. But we didn&#8217;t get it. So, instead we are gunning for second prize.
